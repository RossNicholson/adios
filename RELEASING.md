# Releasing Adios

Releases are automated. **One command:**

```
make release VERSION=1.2.3
```

That bumps the version (`MARKETING_VERSION` in the Xcode project), commits, tags
`v1.2.3`, and pushes. GitHub Actions then builds, **signs**, **notarizes**,
**staples**, publishes the GitHub release, and bumps the Homebrew cask — then
re-downloads the asset and verifies its sha256 + notarization before declaring
success.

**Don't** run `scripts/release.sh --publish` by hand: pushing a tag already
triggers CI, which is the single source of truth. To build a local notarized
test DMG, use `make dmg` (or `scripts/release.sh` with no arguments).

Adios is a sandboxed Safari-extension app and is **not** an XcodeGen project, so
its build (scheme `Adios (macOS)`, DMG with an `/Applications` symlink) is
configured in `scripts/release.sh`. Everything else matches BrewDock/ClawdBar.

## Why this is hard to get wrong
- `make release` refuses to run on a dirty tree, off `main`, with a malformed
  version, or a tag that already exists.
- CI fails fast with a clear message if any required secret is missing.
- CI aborts if the pushed tag doesn't match the version that was actually built.
- Notarization is a hard gate — an un-notarized build cannot ship.
- The publish step is idempotent (safe to re-run after a transient failure).
- After publishing, CI re-downloads the asset and checks its sha256 + notarization.

## Required repo secrets
Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions. The same six are used by BrewDock,
ClawdBar, and Adios:

| Secret | What it is |
|---|---|
| `DEVELOPER_ID_P12_BASE64` | base64 of the Developer ID Application `.p12` |
| `P12_PASSWORD` | the `.p12` export password |
| `NOTARY_API_KEY_P8_BASE64` | base64 of the App Store Connect `.p8` |
| `NOTARY_KEY_ID` | the notary key's ID |
| `NOTARY_ISSUER_ID` | the notary issuer ID |
| `TAP_PUSH_TOKEN` | fine-grained PAT, `contents:write` on `RossNicholson/homebrew-tap` only |
